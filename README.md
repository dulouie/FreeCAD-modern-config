# FreeCAD modern config
This repository contains FreeCAD macro that attempt to make Freecad look more like a modern CAD system.
Mainly the colors and the general look are changed, the interaction of the colors was important to me. The script also changes some other parameters that are standard on modern computers. If you don't want them, you can simply delete them from the script.
The panel layout is also changed, so the newly activated treeview is on the left side and the comboview is fixed on the right side. All toolbars of the workbenches are displayed on top, but some are disabled to improve the overview.
